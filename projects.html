        <p class = "center">From the summer of 2015 I have been working with <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com/">NGPVAN</a> as a product intern. My tasks have included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Completing user research through talking to marketing and sales,</li>
          <li>Synthesising my research into <a href="http://progress.ngpvan.com/design/personas">user personas</a>,</li>
          <li>Designing new interfaces for the company,</li>
          <li>Developing these new designs into features for the product, and</li>

        <ul> 
          <li>A personal learning environment and task management system for a classmate,</li>
          <li>A booth in a public space to teach Olin students about mental health issues on campus, and</li>

        <p class = "center">For this course my sophomore year, I was paired with a user group - in my case hotline volunteers - and we worked with them throughout the entire semester to understand their role, values, and needs. Ultimately, we designed a product for them called the empact. The empact is a wearable device that helps both volunteers and students keep track of their language in order to use more empowering and impactful language in both their everyday lives as well as on call.</p>

        <h1 class = "center">Education Research</h1>
        <p class = "center">For two years I have done education research using a process called discourse analysis to analyze teamwork. Specifically, we look at patterns of speech between members: who talks when, who initiates conversations, who asks questions and of what type, and who does not speak, and why. We have presented at two conferences so far: <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/281065113_Using_Discourse_Analysis_to_Understand_Failure_Modes_of_Undergraduate_Engineering_Teams">the 2014 Fronteirs in Education conference in Madrid, Spain,</a> and the National Association for Reserach in Science Teaching Conference in 2015 in Chicago, Il. We are continuing our study and are now following students logitudinally to see if they improve their teamwork skills as they progress through their undergraduate education.</p>

        <p class = "center">The final project for my introductory software engineering class was <a href="http://aditisjoshi.github.io/On-The-Right-Course/">a data visualization tool</a> to help Olin College students decide what classes to take in any given semester. Students could use the Graphical User Interface to pick a certain semester and major and the software would give them the most often taken classes during that given semester. The program leveraged the past data of course registration to inform students about what most students have taken during that semester given a certain major.</p>

        <p class = "center">During this class I was paired with an older adult couple who had come to the United States recently from China. They spoke minimal English but had to often travel on public transporation and communicate with their doctor. Through the course of the semester, we created a set of videos for them so that they could manage daily tasks. We also realized that the interface of the video player was not easily usable for them, and so we created a new media player skin that was much easier to use.</p>

        <p class = "center">The final project for this class was "Studio C". Studio C is a mobile maker space and studio for students to use or take off of campus for outreach and education activities. The space is outfitted with multiple standing desks for room and outlets to put in small, mobile devices, such as a 3D printer, a vinyl cutter, or a tabletop CNC router. It gives students a new place to work or a way of taking their workspace elsewhere.</p>
