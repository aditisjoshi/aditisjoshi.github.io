        <p class = "center teal">For this course my sophomore year, I was paired with a user group - in my case hotline volunteers - and we worked with them throughout the entire semester to understand their role, values, and needs. Ultimately, we designed a product for them called the empact. The empact is a wearable device that helps both volunteers and students keep track of their language in order to use more empowering and impactful language in both their everyday lives as well as on call.</p>

        <p class = "center red">For two years I have done education research using a process called discourse analysis to analyze teamwork. Specifically, we look at patterns of speech between members: who talks when, who initiates conversations, who asks questions and of what type, and who does not speak, and why. We have presented at two conferences so far: <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/281065113_Using_Discourse_Analysis_to_Understand_Failure_Modes_of_Undergraduate_Engineering_Teams">the 2014 Frontiers in Education conference in Madrid, Spain,</a> and the National Association for Reserach in Science Teaching Conference in 2015 in Chicago, Il. We are continuing our study and are now following students logitudinally to see if they improve their teamwork skills as they progress through their undergraduate education.</p>

Students could use the Graphical User Interface to pick a certain semester and major and the software would give them the most often taken classes during that given semester. The program leveraged the past data of course registration to inform students about what most students have taken during that semester given a certain major.</p>

They spoke minimal English but had to often travel on public transporation and communicate with their doctor. Through the course of the semester, we created a set of videos for them so that they could manage daily tasks. We also realized that the interface of the video player was not easily usable for them, and so we created a new media player skin that was much easier to use.</p>

Studio C is a mobile maker space and studio for students to use or take off of campus for outreach and education activities. The space is outfitted with multiple standing desks for room and outlets to put in small, mobile devices, such as a 3D printer, a vinyl cutter, or a tabletop CNC router. It gives students a new place to work or a way of taking their workspace elsewhere.</p>
