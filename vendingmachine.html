        <p class="strong">CONTEXT AND IDEA</p>
        <p class="italic">the vending machine of the sexual health future</p>
        <p>I believe that design has an important role in achieving feminist aims. Over the course of a semester, I read critical feminist theory books as well as feminist design writing. I used this to think about what the future could look like, specifically looking at sexual health. I designed a range of products, from period boxers, to clitoris condoms, to ovulation tracking. Some of these products were utopian and some dystopian. I placed these in a vending machine to demonstrate the commodification of sexual health as well as a sense of increased public openness around these topics. These products were designed to spark a conversation and were displayed alongside a showing of the Vagina Monologues that I directed, to show the longitudinal and historical changes that sexual health has gone through, thereby inciting conversations about its future.</p>
